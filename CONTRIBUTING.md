# Contributing

## General rules

1. **English/Korean only** for issues & pull requests.
2. **Do not edit `README.md`.** This file is automatically generated.
3. **Use the templates** when submitting an Issue or Pull Request. Blank Issues/PRs are not allowed.
4. Commit using [Conventional Commits spec](https://conventionalcommits.org/).

## How to submit a change

1. Create your Pull Request with your changes.
   - Remember to **not** edit `README.md`!
   - As with Issues, fill out the template as best you can.
2. For PR's relating to alternatives, please follow the steps above to also create an Issue for discussion. Simple PR's that are unrelated to a specific alternative may not require an Issue. If in doubt, create an **Other** Issue.
